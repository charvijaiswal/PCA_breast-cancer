# PCA_breast-cancer

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique used to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does so by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered such that the first few retain most of the variation present in the original variables.

**About the dataset**
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains the following features, which are computed from digitized images of breast cancer tissue:
1. mean radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
2. mean texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
3.mean perimeter: Mean length of the cancer cellâ€™s perimeter.
4.mean area: Mean area of the cell nuclei.
5.mean smoothness: Mean of local variation in radius lengths.
6.mean compactness: Mean of the ratio of (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0).
7.mean concavity: Mean of the severity of concave portions of the contour.
8.mean concave points: Mean number of concave portions of the contour.
9.mean symmetry: Mean of symmetry of the cell nuclei.
