# PCA_breast-cancer

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique used to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does so by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered such that the first few retain most of the variation present in the original variables.

**About the dataset**
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains the following features, which are computed from digitized images of breast cancer tissue:
- mean radius
- mean texture
- mean perimeter
- mean area
- mean smoothness
- mean compactness
- mean concavity
- mean concave points
- mean symmetry
- mean fractal dimension
- radius error
- texture error
- perimeter error
- area error
- smoothness error
- compactness error
- concavity error
- concave points error
- symmetry error
- fractal dimension error
- worst radius
- worst texture
- worst perimeter
- worst area
- worst smoothness
- worst compactness
- worst concavity
- worst concave points
- worst symmetry
- worst fractal dimension
