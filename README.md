Principal Component Analysis on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does so by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered such that the first few retain most of the variation present in the original variables.
