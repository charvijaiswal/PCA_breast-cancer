**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique used to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does so by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered such that the first few retain most of the variation present in the original variables.

The explained variance ratio in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) measures the proportion of the total variance in the dataset that is captured by each principal component. It provides insight into how much of the original data's variability is retained by the principal components.

**About the dataset**
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains the following features, which are computed from digitized images of breast cancer tissue:
- mean radius
- mean texture
- mean perimeter
- mean area
- mean smoothness
- mean compactness
- mean concavity
- mean concave points
- mean symmetry
- mean fractal dimension
- radius error
- texture error
- perimeter error
- area error
- smoothness error
- compactness error
- concavity error
- concave points error
- symmetry error
- fractal dimension error
- worst radius
- worst texture
- worst perimeter
- worst area
- worst smoothness
- worst compactness
- worst concavity
- worst concave points
- worst symmetry
