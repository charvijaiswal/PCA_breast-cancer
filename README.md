# PCA_breast-cancer

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a statistical technique used to simplify the complexity in high-dimensional data while retaining trends and patterns. It does so by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and ordered such that the first few retain most of the variation present in the original variables.

**About the dataset**
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset contains the following features, which are computed from digitized images of breast cancer tissue:
1. mean radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
2. mean texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
